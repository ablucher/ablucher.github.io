Under construction as of 9/24/20, please check back later !

Welcome! I am a computational biologist working in cancer research to find more precise and effective treatment options for cancer patients. In my research, I work on understanding how our cancer drugs work, how to choose the best drugs for each patient's tumor, and how to predict how patients will respond to therapies. My training in bioinformatics, cancer systems biology, and data science enables me to extract meaningful insights across tumor data types to better understand drug response. 

My methods focus on using pathway and network approaches to integrate across multiple tumor data types (such as mutation, copy number, and expression data) to find higher level patterns of drug sensivity, drug resistance, and tumor progression. 

Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Mills Lab at the Knight Cancer Institute. I work with a collaborative team of researchers to understand how breast, ovarian, and endometrial tumors respond to the therapies we give them, and how to better drug tumors that develop resistance mechanisms to evade our drugs. I'm also the Metadata Workgroup Lead for the Knight Data Governance Committee, where I work with an enthusiastic group to assess metadata needs and promote metadata standards for Knight research labs. This fall you'll also find me coordinating logistics for the awesome crew of Girls Who Code PDX. 


## Current Interests and Projects:
- Drug sensivitiy and resistance for cancer therapies
- Prioritizing combination therapies
- Understanding how our drugs work 
- Druggability assessments
- Pathway and network modeling methods
- Probabilistic graphical models
