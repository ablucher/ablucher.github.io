Welcome! I am a computational biologist working in cancer research to find more precise and effective treatment options for cancer patients. 

Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Mills Lab at the Knight Cancer Institute. I work with a collaborative team of researchers to understand how breast, ovarian, and endometrial tumors respond to the therapies we give them, and how to better therapeutically target tumors that develop resistance mechanisms to evade our drugs.


## Current Interests and Projects:
- Drug sensivitiy and resistance for cancer therapies
- Prioritizing combination therapies
- Understanding how our drugs work 
- Druggability assessments
- Pathway and network modeling methods
- Probabilistic graphical models
